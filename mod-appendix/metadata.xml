《FTL船长版》是一个旨在让关卡上多样化和扩展《FTL》游戏玩法的Mod。该mod试图匹配游戏的背景，画风和基调。虽然它添加了许多新内容，但它也旨在维持游戏的平衡性。


FTL Captain's Edition is a major overhaul mod-compilation that aims to diversify and extend FTL's game-play on different levels. The mod tries to match the games lore, graphic style and general tone. While it adds a lot of new content, it also aims to maintain the balance of the vanilla game.

Mod Load Order
When you patch the mods in via SMM, not loading mods in the right order can cause various problems (visual glitches in some events, crystal sector spawning instead of deepspace, etc).
Therefore you have to get the mods into the right order, simply by dragging them around in the mod manager window. In the end, your load-order should look like this:

Code: Select all
    |   Any non-ship not-CE-related mods you are using
    |   Better Planets and Backgrounds
    |   CE Resource Pack
    |   FTL Captain's Edition
    |   CE BPaB Compatibility Patch
    |   CE Additional Music Addon
    |   CE Infinite Addon
    |   CE Additional Music Infinite Compatibility patch
    |   EL Texture Pack
    |   CE Endless Loot Addon for CE Infinite
    |   or
    |   CE Endless Loot Addon standard CE (never use both)
    |   CE Non-EL Enemy Loadouts Addon
    |   CE Vanilla Player Ship Loadouts Addon
    |   Extended Pursuit Indicator x2/x3/x5/x24
    |   Random Flagship
    |   Rand-[trel/orus/asio/wark/a Monster/prey]
    V   Any ship mods you are using


Obviously this list does not imply that you have to use everything that is in it. Choose your mods according to the experience you want. Read the descriptions below the download links and the detailed descriptions in this post and decide which components of CE you want to use. Then use only patch in the mod components that are relevant for you.

Compatibility Notes
Note: incompatibility does not necessary mean the game crashes, things might just not work properly.
- Outright incompatible with Balanced Arsenal, New Enemy Classes, Diversity Mod and Infinite Space; Don't use these mods alongside
- Incompatible with most enemy mods, weapon mods, drone mods or event mods
- Currently incompatible with the Corpses mod CE addon, causes crashes
- CE Infinite is generally incompatible with anything that changes the crystal sector
- Most other stuff, specially ship mods and visual mods, should work
